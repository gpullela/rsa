# rsa

This project is a continuation of a research paper that I wrote about the Math behind RSA Encryption.
We look to perform RSA Encryption with the help of High Performance Computing, through SMP (Simultaneous Multi-Processes)

We will be using OpenMP and hopefully CUDA C-Programming, to parallelize the algorithm and test the efficiency of the algorithm at a smaller key size, for large scale, high core count processors, such as Big Red II and Nvidia's CUDA Enabled GPUs.
